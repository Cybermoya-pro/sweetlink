## Unreleased

### Added
- SweetLink demo app now shows a live session indicator so you can confirm which CLI codename is linked at a glance.

### Changed
- Documented the CLI ↔ daemon architecture and updated prerequisites in the README to match the Node.js 22+ baseline.
- Switched the CLI, daemon, and shared packages to the MIT License and surfaced the license text in-repo.
